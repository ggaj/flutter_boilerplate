A boilerplate project for Flutter using [RiverPod](https://riverpod.dev/), [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio), [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route), [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) and generated with [very_good_cli](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli).


---

This is a very simple Boilerplate application, this has following features.

  - User can Sign In and Up
  - After signing in he can see a list of items

> It uses a mock json server which doesn't store or validate anything, so for signing in/up any email, password will simply work.

[RiverPod](https://riverpod.dev/) was used for state management, but there's an old implementation with [Flutter bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) as well, you may check out [bloc](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/Flutter/tree/bloc) branch, though that branch doesn't have many of the latest changes.

  
## Getting Started üöÄ

You can go through this [Flutter Starter Pack](https://sadmansamee.github.io/flutter_starter_pack).

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Flutter Boilerplate works on iOS, Android, and Web._

## Use MakeFile / Derry to avoid writing your own scripts.

You can run all these scripts manually or could use  [MakeFile](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/Flutter/blob/master/makefile) / [Derry](https://pub.dev/packages/derry) and maintain a file, where you can define all those scripts and run in a very convinient way. All the scripts for this project is defined here [derry scripts](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/Flutter/blob/master/derry.yaml) and [makefile scripts](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/Flutter/blob/master/makefile)

Example: 

run `make watch` or `derry watch` instead of

```sh
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
``` 


or run `make build_apk_dev` or `derry build_apk_dev` instead of 

```sh
flutter build apk --flavor development -t lib/main_development.dart 
``` 
---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:flutter_boilerplate/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

If you face trouble after with translations, then run 

```
flutter gen-l10n --template-arb-file=arb/app_en.arb
```

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
